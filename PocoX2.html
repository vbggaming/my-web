     &nbsp;&nbsp;Xiaomi's sub-brand,Poco has launched it's Poco X2 to compete with the likes of Realme and Samsung in the budget segment.
     The Poco X2 has a 6.67 inch Full HD+ IPS LCD Display with in display camera. The display has a 120Hz refresh rate. 120Hz refresh rate helps to make the tasks like scrolling through news feed, going through your social apps, scrolling through your app gallery feel very smooth and fast. 120Hz refrest rate means your screen refreshes 120 times every second as compared to the conventional 60Hz refresh rate that we find on most of the mobile phones in this price range. The display quality is very good for an IPS LCD screen. No complaints with the colors and brightness of the display. </p>
   <p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; The Poco X2 has a quad camera set-up with a configuration of 64MP(Main Sensor)+8MP(Wide angel lens)+2MP(Macro lens)+2MP(Depth sensor). The main 64MP lens clicks amazing pictures with natural colors in daylight. The performance of the cameras falls a little in artificial and low light conditions but they it is great for the price. The wide angle lens helps in clicking pictures with wide field of view which means you can cover more area in the frame. The 8MP wide angle lens clicks decent pictures in daylight conditions but the quality of picture falls apart in artificial and low light conditions. Although that is what happens with most of the mobiles in this price range.The 2MP macro lens helps in clicking pictures the objects within very close range to the camera lens. It works alright but only when a lot of light falls on the lens.The 2MP depth sensor only helps in clicking portrait mode pictures.
     The 20MP Front Camera lens clicks good enough pictures with natural skin tones and good amount of details.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poco X2 is powered by the Snapdragon 730G processor which is the best you can currently get in this price segment. This processr can easily handle the day to day activities like multitasking,switching between apps and also handles heavy task easily.It can also play heavy games like Pubg and Call of Duty Mobile on high graphics with high frame rates. The mobile also has liquid cooling which protects the mobile from over heating.
 </p>
 <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Poco X2 is equipped with 4500mAh battery which can easily last for a day and a half for light users and for a day for heavy users in a single charge. The mobile also has a 27W Fast Charger that can charge your mobile completely from 0-100% within an hour.
