     &nbsp;&nbsp;Xiaomi's sub brand Redmi, has launched it's Redmi Note 8 Pro to compete with the likes of Realme and Samsung in the budget segment.
     The Redmi Note 8 Pro has a 6.5 inch Full HD+ IPS LCD Display with a tear drop notch.The display quality is very good for an IPS LCD screen. No complaints with the colors and brightness of the display. </p>
   <p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; The Redmi Note 8 Pro has a quad camera set-up with a configuration of 64MP(Main Sensor)+8MP(Wide angel lens)+2MP(Macro lens)+2MP(Depth sensor). The main 64MP lens clicks amazing pictures with natural colors in daylight.The performance of the cameras falls a little in artificial and low light conditions with alot of noise in the pictures.The wide angle lens helps in clicking pictures with wide field of view which means you can cover more area in the frame. The 8MP wide angle lens clicks good pictures in daylight conditions but the quality of picture falls apart in artificial and low light conditions. Although that is what happens with most of the mobiles in this price range.The 5MP macro lens helps in clicking pictures the objects within very close range to the camera lens. It works alright but only when a lot of light falls on the lens.The 2MP depth sensor only helps in clicking portrait mode pictures.
     The 20MP Front Camera lens clicks good enough pictures with natural skin tones and good amount of details.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Redmi Note 8 Pro is powered by the Mediatek Helio G90T processor which is very powerful for the price.This processr can handle the day to day activities like multitasking,switching between apps easily. This processor can also play pubg on high graphics easily. Although the back of the processor gets a little warm after extended gaming sessions. But ther's no over heathing.
 <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Redmi Note 8 Pro is packed with 4500mAh battery which can easily last for a days and a half for light users and for a single day for heavy users in a single charge. The mobile also has a 18W Fast Charger that take almost two hours to charge fully.
