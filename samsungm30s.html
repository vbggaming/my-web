     &nbsp;&nbsp;Samsung has launched it's Samsung Galaxy M31 to compete with the likes of Realme and Xiaomi in the budget segment.
     The Samsung Galaxy M30s has a 6.4 inch Full HD+ AMOLED Display with a tear drop notch.The display quality is the best you can get for the price.No complaints with the colors and brightness of the display. Although the only drawback is that the display is made by Corning Gorilla glass 3 whereas the competition has the much better Corning Gorilla glass 5. </p>
   <p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; The Samsung Galaxy M30s has a quad camera set-up with a configuration of 48MP(Main Sensor)+8MP(Wide angel lens)+5MP(Macro lens)+5MP(Depth sensor). The main 48MP lens clicks amazing pictures with popping colors in daylight. The skin tones look perfect and pictures clicked are social media ready.The performance of the cameras falls a little in artificial and low light conditions but they it is great for the price.The wide angle lens helps in clicking pictures with wide field of view which means you can cover more area in the frame. The 8MP wide angle lens clicks good pictures in daylight conditions but the quality of picture falls apart in artificial and low light conditions. Although that is what happens with most of the mobiles in this price range.The 5MP macro lens helps in clicking pictures the objects within very close range to the camera lens. It works alright but only when a lot of light falls on the lens.The 5MP depth sensor only helps in clicking portrait mode pictures.
     The 20MP Front Camera lens clicks good enough pictures with natural skin tones and good amount of details.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Samsung Galaxy M30s is powered by the it's own Exynos 9611 processor which is not that powerful. Competiton offers much better processor for the price.This processr can handle the day to day activities like multitasking,switching between apps. Although this processor cannot be recommended for gamers. It can play pubg on HRD and High settings but the frame rates are not at all consistent.
 </p>
 <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Samsung Galaxy M30s is packed with massive 6000mAh battery which can easily last for two days for light users and for a day and a half for heavy users in a single charge. The mobile also has a 15W Fast Charger that take almost two and a half hours to charge fully.
